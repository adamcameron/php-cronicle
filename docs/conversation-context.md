# Dynamic Scheduler Project - Conversation Context

## üéÜ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - EXECUTION TRACKING COMPLETE! üéÜ

Built a complete database-driven scheduled task manager/runner for Symfony that reads task configurations from a database rather than hardcoded attributes. The system now includes full execution tracking with real-time monitoring.

## ‚úÖ FINAL WORKING SOLUTION

### Complete Architecture
- **Database-driven tasks** stored in `DynamicTaskMessage` entity with scheduling metadata
- **Execution tracking** in separate `TaskExecution` entity with one-to-one relationship
- **`DynamicScheduleProvider`** reads from DB and creates `RecurringMessage` objects
- **Timezone conversion** (UTC/Europe/London with BST handling) via `ScheduleTimezoneConverter`
- **Working days filtering** using `WorkingDaysTrigger` decorator (weekends + bank holidays)
- **Automatic cache invalidation** via `TaskChangeListener` ‚Üí worker restart mechanism
- **Template Method logging** in `AbstractTaskHandler` for consistent start/complete/error tracking
- **Service tags discovery** for task handlers with snake_case conversion
- **Real-time execution tracking** - executedAt, executionTime, lastResult, nextScheduledAt

### Worker Restart Solution
**The key breakthrough**: Symfony's scheduler loads messages once at startup - no runtime updates possible. Solution uses `symfony run --watch` to restart worker when tasks change:

1. **Docker setup** creates `/tmp/symfony/schedule-last-updated.dat` during build
2. **TaskChangeListener** writes timestamp to file on entity changes
3. **Worker command**: `symfony run -d --watch=$SCHEDULE_RESTART_FILE php bin/console messenger:consume`
4. **File changes trigger automatic worker restart** with fresh schedule

### Entity Separation (NEW!)
**Problem**: Configuration changes and execution tracking updates both triggered worker restarts.

**Solution**: Split into two entities with proper relationship:
- **`DynamicTaskMessage`** - Pure configuration (type, name, schedule, timezone, priority, active, workingDaysOnly, metadata)
- **`TaskExecution`** - Pure execution tracking (nextScheduledAt, executedAt, executionTime, lastResult)
- **One-to-one relationship** with proper `targetEntity` specifications
- **Unidirectional cascade** - only DynamicTaskMessage ‚Üí TaskExecution, not reverse

### Execution Tracking Implementation
**Complete real-time monitoring system:**
- **AbstractTaskHandler** measures execution time, captures results, updates database
- **TaskMessage** carries full `DynamicTaskMessage` entity through message queue
- **Re-fetch entities** after serialization/deserialization to restore Doctrine managed state
- **Next run calculation** using same timezone conversion as scheduling (`ScheduleTimezoneConverter`)
- **Cron and relative formats** supported via `CronExpression` and `PeriodicalTrigger`
- **Direct EntityManager operations** bypass Doctrine events to prevent worker restarts

### UI Improvements
**Complete user interface for execution monitoring:**
- **Execution tracking columns** in index view: Last Executed | Execution Time | Last Result | Next Scheduled
- **Chronological order** - past execution data before future scheduling
- **Working days form control** - checkbox in edit form positioned with scheduling fields
- **Working days display** - yellow "Yes" badge in listing table
- **UTC timestamps** clearly labeled in column headers
- **Proper null handling** - shows "0ms" instead of "-" for zero execution times

## üêõ MAJOR DEBUGGING SAGA (Evening Session)

### The Doctrine Persist Drama
**Issue**: Tasks updated execution tracking once, then stopped updating.
**Root Cause**: Missing `persist()` call for existing entities - only new entities were being persisted.
**Solution**: Single `persist()` call handles both new and existing entities.

### The Relationship Cascade Chaos  
**Issue**: Updating TaskExecution created duplicate rows and triggered worker restarts.
**Root Cause**: Missing `targetEntity` attributes and bidirectional cascades.
**Solution**: Explicit `targetEntity` specifications and unidirectional cascade only.

### The Entity Detachment Disaster
**Issue**: "A new entity was found through the relationship" Doctrine error.
**Root Cause**: Message queue serialization detached entities from Doctrine's Unit of Work.
**Solution**: Re-fetch entities from database in `updateTaskExecution()` to restore managed state.

### The Timezone Configuration Comedy 
**Issue**: Tasks scheduled for specific times not running when expected.
**Root Cause**: PHP timezone set to `Europe/London` in Docker config while expecting UTC calculations.
**The Kicker**: Developer spent hours debugging, not noticing "Last Executed" was 2 minutes ago instead of 62 minutes ago.
**Ultimate Revelation**: Developer had manually configured PHP timezone as `date.timezone = Europe/London` in own Docker setup.
**Solution**: Change to `date.timezone = UTC` for consistent timezone handling.

### The Schedule Conversion Inconsistency
**Issue**: Next scheduled times calculated incorrectly (wrong timezone).
**Root Cause**: `calculateNextScheduledAt()` used original BST schedule instead of UTC-converted schedule.
**Solution**: Apply same `ScheduleTimezoneConverter` logic in both scheduling and next-run calculations.

## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED

### Real-World Production Features

- **Comprehensive logging** - All tasks log start/complete/error to dedicated `tasks` channel  
- **Timezone aware** - Handles BST/GMT transitions correctly with UTC storage
- **Working days respect** - Skips weekends and UK bank holidays when configured
- **High-frequency testing** - Multiple minute-based intervals for immediate feedback
- **Error handling** - Proper exception logging with context
- **Boundary testing** - Cron ranges (3-59) correctly stop at minute boundaries
- **UI form controls** - Complete working days configuration through interface

### Execution Tracking Validation
- **All tasks updating** - executedAt, executionTime, lastResult, nextScheduledAt
- **Timezone consistency** - UTC storage with proper BST conversion
- **Performance measurement** - Real execution times with `usleep()` testing
- **Schedule calculations** - Both cron expressions and relative formats
- **Working days logic** - Fake bank holiday testing with toggle verification
- **User interface** - Complete visibility of execution status and configuration

## üéØ Core Architecture Patterns Used
- **Template Method Pattern** - `AbstractTaskHandler` provides logging boilerplate
- **Decorator Pattern** - `WorkingDaysTrigger` wraps scheduling triggers  
- **Service Tags** - Auto-discovery of task handlers with snake_case conversion
- **Single Message Type** - `TaskMessage` delegates to appropriate handlers, carries full entity
- **Strategy Pattern** - `ScheduleFormatDetector` determines cron vs relative formats
- **Adapter Pattern** - `BankHolidayServiceAdapter` wraps HTTP client
- **Factory Method** - Dynamic creation of `RecurringMessage` objects
- **Separation of Concerns** - Configuration vs execution tracking entities

## üö® Major Symfony Limitations Discovered
- **Scheduler runtime updates impossible** - Loads messages once at startup, never refreshes
- **Retry strategies too coarse** - Transport/class level only, not per-message instance  
- **No entity parameter on AsDoctrineListener** - Fires for all entities, requires manual filtering
- **AutowireIterator returns RewindableGenerator** - Must convert to array before array access
- **Message queue entity detachment** - Serialization breaks Doctrine managed state

## üõ†Ô∏è Successful Technical Solutions

**Entity Relationship Management:**
- **Problem**: Configuration and execution tracking mixed in single entity
- **Solution**: Clean separation with one-to-one relationship and unidirectional cascade
- **Result**: Configuration changes restart worker, execution updates don't

**Execution Tracking System:**
- **Problem**: No visibility into task performance and scheduling
- **Solution**: Complete monitoring with database storage and UI display
- **Implementation**: Template Method pattern with consistent logging and database updates
- **Result**: Real-time execution tracking with next-run calculations

**Message Queue Entity Handling:**
- **Problem**: Serialized entities become detached from Doctrine context
- **Solution**: Re-fetch entities after deserialization to restore managed state
- **Result**: Reliable database updates without cascade persist errors

**Timezone Configuration Consistency:**
- **Problem**: Mixed timezone handling between PHP and application logic
- **Solution**: Standardize on UTC for PHP with application-level BST conversion
- **Result**: Predictable scheduling behavior with proper timezone display

**Working Days User Experience:**
- **Problem**: Advanced feature hidden from users (database-only configuration)
- **Solution**: Form controls and table display for complete user visibility
- **Result**: Self-service configuration with immediate visual feedback

## Key Technical Decisions Made
- **Entity separation over complex event handling** - cleaner than trying to selectively ignore events
- **Re-fetch over entity merging** - simpler than complex Doctrine state management
- **Template Method over inheritance** - consistent logging without deep inheritance hierarchies
- **UTC standardization** - PHP timezone configuration matches application expectations
- **Form integration over admin tools** - self-service user experience
- **Worker restart over runtime updates** - cleaner than fighting Symfony's architecture
- **Service consolidation** - moved logic to `DynamicScheduleProvider`, eliminated `ScheduleFactory`
- **Trigger decoration pattern** for working days (not `RecurringMessage` decoration)

**The system evolved from a basic task scheduler to a comprehensive task management and monitoring platform with real-time execution tracking, advanced scheduling features, and complete user visibility.**
